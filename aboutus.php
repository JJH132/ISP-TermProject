        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
        	Untitled Pizza is an attempt at a SaaS pizza ordering application for smaller 'mom and pop' type businesses that do 
        	not have as heavy as an internet presence as their big-chain counterparts. The client is able to have a working website 
        	with the ability for users/customers to create accounts, log in, view their account details, and view their past orders. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Another main feature of the application is the employee login. The employee login has two separate functions. The first 
        	and more powerful option is to login as an administrator. After logging in as an administrator, the site redirects you
        	to a page where you, as a social media representative or owner of a pizza shop, are able to customize the website with 
        	one click. You can change several things like the title, logo, name of the website, and the footer code. These elements 
        	change across the whole site, by only typing it in once. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The second function of the employee login is actual 'employee' login. This allows employees of the businesses to access 
        	their pizza order history. After an employee logs in, they are shown a view of all the current orders that have not been 
        	served.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The appeal to the client is that is a unique alternative to something like GrubHub or UberEats, that allows them to 
        	more customize their website, and not just having a section of someone else's website. Sometimes these items aren't listed 
        	correctly, or the order is received correctly.
